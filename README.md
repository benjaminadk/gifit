## Features

### Screen Recorder

Capture the entire screen, or a selected portion, frame-by-frame at a user set frame rate.

### Webcam Recorder

Capture webcam output at a user set size, frame-by-frame at a user set frame rate.

### Editor

#### GIF Encoding

Combine all frames into a single GIF file with each frame persisting for an adjustable amount of time.

**GifIt** uses `gif-encoder` by default. This gets the job done but is time consuming (~25s per 100 images) and relatively inefficient, outputing large files (~12MB per 100 images). As an alternative, **GifIt** can use `ffmpeg` if it is installed locally on the user's machine. On load, **GifIt** will look in the user's _PATH_ for the `ffmpeg` executable, and if found will use it to encode GIFs. This results in a faster (~5s per 100 images) an smaller output (~750KB per 100 images). The user can also browser for and explicitly set a path to the `ffmpeg` executable in options.
