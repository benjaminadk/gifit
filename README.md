# GifIt

Record GIFs

## Objective

This project uses JavaScript to recreate a similar user interface and implement the basic functionality of [_ScreenToGif_](https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif). **ScreenToGif** is a popular (7000‚≠ê) _.NET_ application that allows users to record from their screen, webcam or sketchboard. It is written primarily in _C#_. I was looking for a way to show off some of my projects, and wanted something more complex than an image, but simpler than a video embed. Enter the GIF. When I found **ScreenToGif** and started using it, I was really impressed with the look and usability of the application. Plus, it had so many awesome features.
