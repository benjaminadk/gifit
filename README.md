# GifIt

Record GIFs

## Objective

[**ScreenToGif**](https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif) is a popular (7000‚≠ê) _.NET_ application that allows users to record GIFs from their screen, webcam or sketchboard. It is written primarily in _C#_. I like the application so much I decided to attempt to recreate the basic look and functionality using JavaScript.
