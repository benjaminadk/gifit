</p>

### Screen Recorder

Capture fullscreen, or selected portion, frame-by-frame at a user set frame rate. This is accomplished using **Electron's** `desktopCapturer` with HTML video and canvas elements. The user can pause and resume recording. After the recorder is stopped a new project folder is created containing each frame saved as a PNG as well as other information relating to the project saved in a JSON file.

The screen recorder uses **Electron's** transparent `BrowserWindow` which allows the display of a small recorder user interface.

The `react-rnd` package provides a useful resizable/draggable component that can be used to select a portion of the screen.
